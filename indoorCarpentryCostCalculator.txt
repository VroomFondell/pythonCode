# I began this assignment by defining the variables that were going to be used.
# After I had defined the variables, I defined the required outputs.
# I then broke the program into sections defined by the input/output relations.

# During the process of figuring how the conversions were going to need to be done
# I most often ran into errors regarding mis-keyed variables. One piece I could not sort out
# is how to create a new line using the \n function in the same command line as a input
# function without moving the users' input insertion point to the next line.

# I tested my program in pieces as I assembled it. After having written the outline
# by hand, I created the input and output sections. I then built each block of conversions
# under the "regarding" headings and tested them as they were being completed to ensure
# each function was working correctly before moving to the next.

# The most prominent thing I am taking away from this assignment is the manner
# in which variables are named. I found I had to rename them a few times
# so that they made sense when reading the code to follow how the numbers
# they represented moved through the program. Next time I think I should spend more
# time working out variable names before begining the coding.
