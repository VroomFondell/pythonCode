# I started by banging my head on the desk. A lot. Then I wrote out a general flow chart followed by a list of needed
# variables.

# I had a hard time sorting out the conversion of the interest rates from yearly to monthly.
# And problems understanding the moving of information from arguments to other arguments.
# I got stuck a lot with understanding that order matters more than variable name in passing information
# between functions.

# I'm still struggling with the formatting matting of the display output. Deleting the whitespace and creating
# new lines is eluding me.

# I certainly gained a deeper understanding of the movement of information through functions.
# next go around I will spend more time drawing pictures and flow charts with lots  of lines mapping out
# where information is coming from and going to.

# Getting unstuck this week required recovering from a few days of panic attacks and significant tutoring really.
